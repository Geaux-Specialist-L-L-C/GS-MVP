## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `dev` - Development branch, merge features here
- `feature/feature-name` - Feature branches

### Development Process
1. Create a feature branch from `dev`
2. Implement the feature with appropriate tests
3. Submit a pull request to `dev`
4. After review and approval, merge to `dev`
5. Periodically, merge `dev` into `main` for releases

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/React
- Use ES6+ syntax
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Comment complex logic and component purposes
- Use PropTypes or TypeScript for component prop validation

### CSS
- Use CSS modules for component styling
- Follow BEM naming convention for classes
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Use variables for colors, spacing, and typography

### Accessibility
- Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include appropriate ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation support
- Test with screen readers

## Components Library

### UI Components
- **Button**: Customizable button with various styles and sizes
- **Card**: Content container with optional hover effects

- Cache API responses where appropriate

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Use Jest for unit tests
- Test component rendering and functionality
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- Validate form submissions and validations

### End-to-End Testing
- Use Cypress for E2E testing
- Test critical user flows

### Accessibility Testing
- Use axe-core for automated accessibility tests
- Perform manual keyboard navigation testing

## Deployment Process

### Staging Deployment
1. Merge features into `dev` branch
2. Automated deployment to staging environment
3. Perform QA testing

### Production Deployment
1. Create a release branch from `dev`
2. Perform final QA on release branch
3. Merge to `main` branch
4. Automated deployment to production

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Regular Updates
- Update dependencies monthly
- Review and resolve security vulnerabilities
- Monitor performance metrics

### Code Reviews
